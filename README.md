# 🏦 Python Bank Loan Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a bank loan dataset to uncover insights about borrower behavior, loan approvals, and default risks. It combines Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Power BI visualization dashboards to provide both analytical depth and interactive reporting for financial decision-making.

# 🚀 Project Overview

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan application and repayment records.

Built statistical summaries, trend analysis, and visualizations to identify key patterns.

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track KPIs such as:

Loan approval vs. rejection rates

Borrower income distribution

Default probability by applicant segment

Credit history and repayment performance

Generated a professional report (PDF) summarizing business insights and recommendations.

# 📂 Project Structure

BankLoanAnalysis.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with full EDA, preprocessing, and visualizations.

financial_loan.xlsx → Raw dataset used for analysis.

dashboard.pbix → Power BI interactive dashboard for visual insights.

banklaondashboard.pdf → Exported static version of the dashboard for sharing.

bank loan analysis report.pdf → Summary report containing methodology, insights, and findings.

README.md → Project documentation.

# 📊 Key Insights

Applicants with strong credit history had the highest approval rates, while self-employed individuals had slightly lower approval chances.

Higher income groups tend to have a lower default rate, highlighting income as a critical factor in risk assessment.

Property area showed significant influence on approval likelihood, with urban borrowers more likely to get loans approved.

Built a framework that financial institutions can leverage to streamline loan approval and mitigate default risks.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python → Data cleaning, EDA, visualization (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).

Power BI → Interactive dashboards for stakeholder insights.

Excel → Raw dataset management and initial exploration.

# 📌 How to Run

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dakshsuman/Python-Bank-Loan-Analysis.git
cd Python-Bank-Loan-Analysis
```

# Run the Python Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook BankLoanAnalysis.ipynb
```

Open dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Build predictive ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict loan approvals.

Deploy an interactive Streamlit dashboard for web-based access.

Expand analysis with macro-economic variables (inflation, unemployment rates).

# 🏆 Project Highlights

✔️ Delivered both Python-based analysis and a Power BI dashboard for end-to-end insights.
